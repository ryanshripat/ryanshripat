- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryanshripat. I'm primarily a C# programmer, but like to dabble in different languages.
- 👀 I’m interested in just writing code, and bringing value to customers by building software that is useful.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ES6 and advanced JavaScript since I haven't updated my JS vocabulary in years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects that provide real value.
- 📫 How to reach me: Check out my ill-maintained personal website, [shripat.com](https://shripat.com)
